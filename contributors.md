So you want to help make chisel better? Awesome! Here’s how:

## tl;dr:
* Have a usage question? Ask on Stack Overflow.
* Found a bug? Open an issue
* Proposing a significant change? Consider opening an issue as a RFC first, to get feedback and consensus
* Got code? Open a pull request and pick a reviewer. All pull requests are reviewed before being merged.
* Check out our style guide

## Issue Guidelines
* First search to see whether a similar issue has been raised
* If not, start a new issue by following our issue template
* Forewarning - given our slim development team, low priority issues that require code modifications don’t have a high likelihood of being handled in a timely fashion. However, we will try to reply to your issue.
* We love welcoming new contributors, so if resolving your issue requires a small change, we highly encourage you to take the plunge and submit a pull request! Our reviewer team is more than happy to work with you to get your pull request up to par and merged (and hey, who doesn’t love learning something new?!).

### Milestones
* Every few months or so, the repo admins get together and prioritize which issues should be tackled in the coming months.
* We try to stick to the milestone labels, but no guarantees (given all our developers volunteer their time, it’s not always possible to stick to a schedule).
* If you disagree with how milestones have been assigned, just say something! We value your feedback.

### RFC Guidelines

TODO (look at PEP / SIP / etc)

## Pull Request Review Process

Before submitting code, please make sure code conforms to the style guide. It will reduce the number of review 
iterations which saves everyone time (especially you!).

As provided by the pull request template, please indicate the impact of your PR (to the best of your knowledge):
* API Modification (change to existing APIs or behavior)
* API Addition (added API that will require backwards compatibility)
* No functional change (e.g. bug-fixes, performance enhancements)

TODO include more information
